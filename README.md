# 20Cafés/dia Official Website
### 100% Created and Hosted by Eduardo Correia | Azenyr

### This is the almost complete source code for my website [20cafes.com](https://20cafes.com)
*Some code was not included for security reasons (had private info and private access keys).*

### What is 20Cafés/dia?
It is a project (and a community) that me and 2 more friends are building. It focuses on being a portuguese technology and gaming community that everyone can join and be a part of. We mainly create [YouTube Content](https://bit.ly/20cafesyoutube) but we are also preset on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/20cafespordia) where we do livestreams of tech events and watch the together with our viewers, where we play together, and where we do revies/unboxings and/or Desktop PCs/Hardware builds.

This website is made using Angular 10, wrote in Typescript, HTML5 and SCSS.
It connects to Google Firebase for some experimental storage and small database (im currently using it to create a small online e-commerce page on this same website, all from scratch).
The website has Google Auth login and Google Accounts functionality, but currently is a function that is not supposed to be accessed publicly.

### It was completely made from scratch by me: Eduardo Correia (owner of this github).
