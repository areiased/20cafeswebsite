# 20Caf√©s/dia Official Website (20cafes.com)

###This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4.

##This is the almost complete source code for the website
[20cafes.com](https://20cafes.com)

Some code was not included for security reasons (had private info and private access keys).

This website is made using Angular 10, wrote in Typescript, HTML5 and SCSS.
It connects to Google Firebase for some experimental storage and small database (im currently using it to create a small online e-commerce page on this same website, all from scratch).
The website has Google Auth login and Google Accounts functionality, but currently is a function that is not supposed to be accessed publicly.

###It was completely made from scratch by me: Eduardo Correia (owner of this github).
